Current Progress Made:
-- reading in and running commands is done, including pipes, should be able to multiple pipes?
-- basic error checks for >, <, << and >>, and their interactions with |.

What's Left?:
-- error checks for input (SHOULD BE MOSTLY DONE)

-- environment bash variables (Linked List probs)
-- need to add more input checks to insert environment variables in when they r required, (Handle the ' and " characters correctly)

-- signals and stuff (idk how its gonna work, maybe git it if google and playing around turn up nothing?)
-- Signals should occur before the main readline function call, and then revert back to normal directly after that same readline call.
-- Have idea about how ctrl+c and ctrl+\ should work, but ctrl+D is a nightmare since it does actaully send a signal, google for more info.

-- Build all builtin functions and either create them as executables or include another checking function to run these functions different to all other commands.

estimated time left roughly:
50 hours maybe? thats including some major bugs and stuff popping up
optimally maybe 20ish
