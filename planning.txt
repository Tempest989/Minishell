Current Progress Made:
-- reading in works, with ft_split up and running
-- no error checking yet, later
-- no execution stage, but is mostly done from pipex

What's Left?:
-- error checks for input
-- execution stage implementation (shouldn't take long)
-- flags and stuff still needed (<, <<, >, >> etc) (copy from pipex mostly)
-- environmental bash variables (via hashtable maybe?)
-- signals and stuff (idk how its gonna work, maybe git it if google and playing around turn up nothing?)

estimated time left roughly:
50 hours maybe? thats including some major bugs and stuff popping up
optimally maybe 20ish
